Day 2 :-

Isometric Cozy Room – Blender

This project is an isometric cozy room created in Blender using only basic shapes. The focus is on clean topology and a non-destructive workflow.

Key Techniques

Built from primitives (cube, plane, cylinder)

Modifiers used:

Bevel

Subdivision Surface

Solidify

No messy booleans or destructive edits

Edge flow kept simple and quad-based

Purpose

Practice clean topology

Improve modifier stacking

Understand low-to-mid poly modeling

Build visually appealing scenes with minimal complexity

Tools

Blender (Eevee/Cycles compatible)

This project is purely for learning and skill-building, not realism or asset optimization.

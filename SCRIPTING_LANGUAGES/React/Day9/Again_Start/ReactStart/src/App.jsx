// react - based on components, declarative, state-driven-js library.
// frameworks those make on top of react is next js and remix.
//react was created in 2011 by jordan walke, an engineer working at facebook at the time.

// react is really good in
// Rendering components on a webpage(UI) based on their current state.
// Keeping the UI in sync with state, by re-rendering(reacting) when state changes.

// Escape hatches page on react documentation , in advance react read later, also a reference section.

// Two option for setup react by create-react-app and vite.

// create-react-app - complete "starter kit" for react application
//Everything is already configured: Eslint, prettier, Jest, etc.
//uses slow and outed technologies (i.e. webpack)
//use for tut or experiments, but dont use for real world app.


//Vite - Modern build tool that contains a template for setting up react applications.
//Need to manually set up EsLint(and others)
//use for modern real world apps.
//Extremely fast hot module replacement(HMR) and bundling

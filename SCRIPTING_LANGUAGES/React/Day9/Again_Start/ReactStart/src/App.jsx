// react - based on components, declarative, state-driven-js library.
// frameworks those make on top of react is next js and remix.
//react was created in 2011 by jordan walke, an engineer working at facebook at the time.

// react is really good in
// Rendering components on a webpage(UI) based on their current state.
// Keeping the UI in sync with state, by re-rendering(reacting) when state changes.

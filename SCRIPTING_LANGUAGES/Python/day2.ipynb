    "Integers (int): Whole numbers.Deep Knowledge: Unlike languages like C++ or Java, Python integers have arbitrary precision. This means they can be as big as your computer's memory allows. You can calculate $2^{1000}$ without an overflow error.\n",

    "Floating Point (float): Decimal numbers.Deep Knowledge: These strictly follow the IEEE 754 standard (double precision). Be careful: computers struggle with precise decimal math (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 might output 0.30000000000000004 due to binary representation limits)\n",

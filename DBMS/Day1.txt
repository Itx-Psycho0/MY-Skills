What “raw facts” means

Data is just values:

Numbers: 23, 1001

Text: "Psycho", "India"

Dates: 2026-01-21

Signals: clicks, sensor readings, logs

# Data vs Information (this matters)

Data → raw, unprocessed

Information → data + context + meaning

Example:

Data: 23

Information: Age = 23 years

1. What Data really is

Data = raw facts or observations collected from the real world.

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

Examples:

101

"Delhi"

true

2026-01-21

A click

A sensor reading

Data has NO meaning by itself.
Meaning comes later.

2. Data vs Information vs Knowledge (don’t mess this up)
Data

Raw, unprocessed facts

101

Information

Data + context

Roll number = 101

Knowledge

Information + understanding

Roll number 101 belongs to Psycho, a CSE student


Most people never move beyond data. Professionals do.

3. Types of Data (important)
A. By structure

Structured data

Tables, rows, columns

Easy to search

Example: SQL databases

Semi-structured data

Has format, but flexible

Example: JSON, XML

Unstructured data

No fixed format

Example: images, videos, emails, audio

Reality check: 80% of real-world data is unstructured

B. By content

Numeric → marks, age, price

Text → names, messages

Boolean → true / false

Date & Time → logs, timestamps

Media → images, audio, video

4. Data lifecycle (how data lives)

Data creation

User input

Sensors

Logs

Data collection

Data storage

Databases

Files

Data processing

Cleaning

Sorting

Filtering

Data analysis

Data usage

Data deletion / archiving

Bad systems fail at step 3 and 4.

5. Why data is valuable

Data helps you:

Make decisions

Predict outcomes

Automate systems

Train AI

Track behavior

But here’s the truth:

Data itself is useless unless it’s clean, structured, and correct.

Garbage data → garbage results.

6. Data + Database

A database:

Stores data

Organizes it

Protects it

Makes it searchable

A schema:

Defines what data is allowed

Prevents garbage entry

No schema = future disaster.

7. Data security (critical)

Data must be:

Accurate

Consistent

Secure

Available

Recoverable

If data leaks or corrupts, systems die.
That’s why companies pay insane money for people who understand data.

8. Brutal truths you should remember

Data is not intelligence

More data ≠ better system

Poor data design kills performance

Most bugs come from bad data assumptions

If you master data thinking, everything else (databases, backend, AI, security) becomes easier.

Final mental model (burn this in)

Data → raw facts

Schema → rules

Database → organized storage

Information → meaningful output

Knowledge → understanding

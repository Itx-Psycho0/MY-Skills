    "What is Time Complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity is a computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, which helps to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Space Complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity is a computational complexity that describes the amount of memory space it takes to run an algorithm. Like time complexity, space complexity is also expressed using big O notation, which helps to classify algorithms according to how their memory requirements grow as the input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptotic Notations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to describe the behavior of functions as their input size approaches infinity. They are commonly used in computer science to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. The three most common asymptotic notations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Big O Notation (O):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate. It provides an upper limit on the time or space complexity, indicating the worst-case scenario.\n",
    "   - Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it means that in the worst case, the time taken by the algorithm will grow quadratically with the input size n.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Omega Notation (Ω):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Omega notation describes the lower bound of an algorithm's growth rate. It provides a lower limit on the time or space complexity, indicating the best-case scenario.\n",
    "   - Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n), it means that in the best case, the time taken by the algorithm will grow linearly with the input size n.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Theta Notation (Θ):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Theta notation describes a tight bound on an algorithm's growth rate. It indicates that the time or space complexity grows at the same rate in both the upper and lower bounds.\n",
    "   - Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(n log n), it means that the time taken by the algorithm grows at the rate of n log n for both the best and worst cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Time Complexities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constant Time - O(1)\n",
    "2. Logarithmic Time - O(log n)  \n",
    "3. Linear Time - O(n)\n",
    "4. Linearithmic Time - O(n log n)\n",
    "5. Quadratic Time - O(n^2)\n",
    "6. Cubic Time - O(n^3)\n",
    "7. Exponential Time - O(2^n)\n",
    "8. Factorial Time - O(n!)\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "comparing Time Complexities:\n",
    "\n",
    "O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2) < O(n^3) < O(2^n) < O(n!)\n",

    "What is Recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. A recursive function typically has two main components: a base case that stops the recursion and a recursive case that breaks the problem down into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a simple recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python   \n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1\n",
    "    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    # Recursive case: n * factorial of (n-1)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down how this function works:\n",
    "1. Base Case: The function checks if n is 0 or 1. If so, it returns 1. This is the stopping condition for the recursion.\n",
    "2. Recursive Case: If n is greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument (n-1) and multiplies the result by n. This continues until the base case is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop vs Recursion:Loops and recursion are both techniques used to repeat a block of code multiple times, but they do so in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loops:\n",
    "   - A loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.\n",
    "   - Common types of loops include for loops and while loops.\n",
    "   - Loops are generally more memory efficient than recursion because they do not involve multiple function calls and stack frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recursion:\n",
    "   - Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.\n",
    "   - Each recursive call creates a new stack frame, which can lead to higher memory usage and potential stack overflow if the recursion depth is too deep.\n",
    "   - Recursion can be more elegant and easier to read for problems that have a natural recursive structure, such as tree traversal or the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "what is base case and recursive case?\n",
    "\n",
    "In recursion, the base case and recursive case are two essential components that define how a recursive function operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Base Case:\n",
    "   - The base case is the condition under which the recursive function stops calling itself. It provides a simple, non-recursive solution to the problem.\n",
    "   - The base case is crucial because it prevents infinite recursion and ensures that the function eventually terminates.\n",
    "   - Example: In a factorial function, the base case is when n is 0 or 1, where the factorial is defined to be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recursive Case:\n",
    "   - The recursive case is the part of the function where it calls itself with a smaller or simpler input.\n",
    "   - This is where the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "   - Example: In a factorial function, the recursive case is when the function calls itself with (n-1) and multiplies the result by n.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a recursive function is called, each call is added to the call stack, which keeps track of all the active function calls. Each time the function calls itself, a new frame is pushed onto the stack. When a base case is reached, the function starts returning values, and each frame is popped off the stack as the function calls complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive tree is a visual representation of the recursive calls made by a function. Each node in the tree represents a function call, and the branches represent the subsequent recursive calls made by that function. The root of the tree represents the initial call to the function, and the leaves represent the base cases where the recursion stops.\n",

//Day 4
// Data Structure:-
// A Ds is a specific way of organizing storing, and accessing data.

//Algorithms:-
// Is the step by step process to solving that problem.

// Big O notation:
// Big O notation helps  us understand how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows.

//(O)n :- Signifies that the execution time of the algorithm grows lineaerly in proportion to the size of the input data(n).

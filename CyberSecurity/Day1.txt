What is Networking?

Computer networking is the backbone of modern technology—it is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share resources (like files, printers, or internet access).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Networking Needed?

Because of 
- Foundation of all atacks and defence
- Network Visibility
- Effective Incident Response
- Real World Exploits Depend on it

History of Networking?

Here is the in-depth evolution of networking, divided into 5 Definitive Eras.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Era 1: The Theoretical Spark (Early 1960s)
The Motivation: Survivability

Before networks, computers were massive mainframes that worked in isolation. If you wanted to move data, you carried magnetic tapes manually.

The US Department of Defense (DoD) had a problem: if a nuclear attack destroyed a central communication hub, their entire command structure would go dark. They needed a network that was decentralized—one that could route messages around damaged cities.

The Key Invention: Packet Switching

Paul Baran (USA) and Donald Davies (UK) independently invented this concept.

Instead of sending a continuous signal (like a telephone call), they proposed breaking data into small "blocks" (packets). If one route was blocked, the packets would automatically find another way.

Note: The big telephone companies (like AT&T) hated this idea and refused to build it, claiming it wouldn't work. They were wrong.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Era 2: The "Lo" Moment (1969)
The Birth of ARPANET

The DoD’s research arm (ARPA) decided to build this theoretical network themselves. They called it ARPANET.


Oct 29, 1969 (10:30 PM): The first message was sent.

Sender: Charley Kline (a student at UCLA).

Receiver: A computer at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).

The Message: Kline intended to type LOGIN. He typed L, then O... and the system crashed.


Result: The first message ever sent over the internet was simply: "Lo".

By the end of 1969, only 4 computers were connected. This was the infant Internet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Era 3: The "Language" Crisis (1970s)
The Invention of Rules

As more networks sprang up, a new problem emerged: incompatability. A network in Hawaii (ALOHAnet) couldn't talk to a network in London because they used different hardware and code.

1973 - Ethernet: Robert Metcalfe at Xerox PARC invented a way to connect computers within a single building using cables. This became the standard for Local Area Networks (LANs).

1974 - The "Internet" Concept: Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published a paper proposing a "Transmission Control Protocol" (TCP). They wanted a universal language that would allow any network to talk to any other network.


Jan 1, 1983 - "Flag Day": ARPANET officially switched its old protocols to TCP/IP. This is considered the true birthday of the modern Internet. Now, different networks were unified into an "Inter-net."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Era 4: The Web Revolution (1989–1995)
Making it Human-Readable

Up until the late 80s, the internet was just text, green screens, and complex commands. It was for scientists, not regular people.

1989 - The World Wide Web: Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN (Switzerland), invented a system to link documents together using "Hypertext." He created:

HTML: To format pages.

URL: To give pages an address.

HTTP: To send the pages.

1993 - Mosaic: The first popular web browser with images. Suddenly, the internet wasn't just code; it was pictures, colors, and clicks.

The Dot-Com Boom: Companies realized they could sell things online. Amazon and eBay were founded in this era.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Era 5: The Mobile & Cloud Era (2000s–Present)
Cutting the Cord

Wi-Fi (1999/2000s): The IEEE 802.11 standard became popular. Networking was no longer tethered to a wall socket.

The iPhone (2007): Put a fully networked computer in everyone's pocket. Mobile data traffic exploded.

Cloud Computing: Instead of storing data on your own hard drive (like in the 90s), high-speed networks allowed us to store everything on someone else's server (AWS, Google Drive, iCloud).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Core Types of Networks -------

Networks are primarily categorized by the geographical size they cover.

- PAN (Personal Area Network): The smallest type. It connects devices within an individual's workspace (e.g., connecting your phone to your laptop via Bluetooth).


- LAN (Local Area Network): Connects devices within a single limited area, like a home, office, or building. Most commonly uses Ethernet (cables) or Wi-Fi.


- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Spans a larger area like a city or a large campus. Cable TV networks are a classic example.



- WAN (Wide Area Network): Spans countries or continents. The Internet is the largest and most famous WAN.

- Data Transfer Terms

1. The "Speed" Terms (Capacity & Delay)
These terms describe how fast and how much data can move. People often confuse them, but they are physically different properties.

Bandwidth vs. Throughput
Bandwidth (The Pipe Width): The theoretical maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a specific time.

Analogy: A 4-lane highway. It can handle 4,000 cars per hour.

Throughput (The Actual Traffic): The actual amount of data effectively transferred. This is almost always lower than bandwidth due to errors, protocol overhead, and congestion.

Analogy: Even on that 4-lane highway, if there is roadwork, you might only get 2,000 cars per hour.

Latency (The Delay)
The time it takes for a single piece of data (packet) to travel from source to destination.

Ping: The tool used to measure latency (measured in milliseconds, ms).

Jitter: The variation in latency. If your ping is 20ms, then 150ms, then 20ms, you have "high jitter." This kills real-time activities like gaming or VoIP calls.

Visual Analogy: Imagine a water pipe.

Bandwidth = How wide the pipe is (Gallons per second).

Latency = How long it takes a single drop of water to travel from the tap to the bucket.

2. The "Direction" Terms (Transmission Modes)
These terms describe the flow direction of the data traffic.

A. Simplex
Data flows in one direction only.

Characteristics: The sender cannot receive; the receiver cannot reply.

Examples: Keyboard to CPU, Radio broadcasting (the radio station speaks, you listen).

Diagram: Sender ----------------> Receiver

B. Half-Duplex
Data flows in both directions, but not at the same time.

Characteristics: Like a one-lane bridge. You must wait for the other side to finish before you can send.

Examples: Walkie-Talkies ("Over and out"), Hubs (legacy networking hardware).

Diagram: Sender <--------------> Receiver (One at a time)

C. Full-Duplex
Data flows in both directions simultaneously.

Characteristics: Like a two-way street. You can talk and listen at the same time.

Examples: Telephones, Modern Switched Ethernet networks.

Diagram: Sender ==============> Receiver (Simultaneous)

3. The "Method" Terms (Transmission Types)
How are the bits (1s and 0s) physically placed onto the wire?

Serial vs. Parallel
Parallel Transmission: Sending multiple bits at the same time over multiple wires.

Pros: Fast for short distances.

Cons: Expensive (thick cables) and suffers from "crosstalk" (interference between wires) over long distances.

Example: Old Printer ports (LPT), Internal CPU buses.

Serial Transmission: Sending bits one by one, sequentially, over a single channel.

Pros: Cheaper cabling, can travel very long distances, and (surprisingly) modern serial is faster than old parallel (e.g., USB = Universal Serial Bus).

Example: USB, Ethernet, SATA.

Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
Synchronous: The sender and receiver share a Clock Signal. They agree on exactly when to read a bit. It is efficient but requires complex hardware.

Asynchronous: No shared clock. Data is sent with "Start" and "Stop" bits so the receiver knows when data is arriving. It is simpler but has more "overhead" (wasted bits).

4. The "Audience" Terms (Casting)
Who is the data intended for?

Unicast (One-to-One): Data is sent from one computer to one specific recipient.

Example: You browsing a website.

Broadcast (One-to-All): Data is sent from one computer to everyone on the network.

Example: ARP requests ("Who has IP 192.168.1.1?").

Multicast (One-to-Many): Data is sent from one computer to a specific group of subscribers.

Example: Live TV streaming over IP, Zoom meetings.

Anycast (One-to-Nearest): Data is sent to the "closest" server geographically.

Example: DNS servers (Google's 8.8.8.8 exists in hundreds of locations; you connect to the one closest to you).

==================================================================================================================================================================================================

- Network Topologies (The Layout)
Topology refers to how the network is physically or logically arranged.

- Bus: All devices are connected to a single central cable (the "backbone").

Pros: Cheap, easy to set up.

Cons: If the backbone breaks, the whole network goes down.

-----------------

- Star: All devices connect to a central device (Switch or Hub). This is the most common modern topology (like your home Wi-Fi).


Pros: If one cable breaks, only that device is affected.

Cons: If the central switch fails, the network stops.

-------------------

- Ring: Devices are connected in a closed loop. Data travels in one direction (token passing).

Pros: No collisions (data traffic jams).

Cons: One broken cable breaks the entire ring.

--------------------

- Mesh: Devices are interconnected (Full Mesh = every device connects to every other device).

Pros: Extremely reliable; if one link fails, data finds another path.

Cons: Very expensive due to cabling. Used in critical infrastructure.

==================================================================================================================================================================================================

The OSI Model (7 Layers)
This is a theoretical reference model used to standardize communication.

Layer 7 - Application: What the user sees (Web browser, HTTP).

Layer 6 - Presentation: Translation and encryption (JPEG, SSL).

Layer 5 - Session: Manages the connection session between computers.

Layer 4 - Transport: Reliable delivery and error checking (TCP, UDP).

Layer 3 - Network: Routing and logical addressing (IP Addresses).

Layer 2 - Data Link: Physical addressing (MAC Addresses) and switching.

Layer 1 - Physical: The actual hardware (Cables, Radio waves, Hubs).

Mnemonic: Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away (Physical -> Application)

==================================================================================================================================================================================================

1. Client-Server Architecture
The Hierarchy: "The Boss and the Workers"

This is the standard model used by the Internet (World Wide Web), corporate networks, and email systems. It is centralized.

How It Works
There is a distinct separation of roles.

The Server (The Provider): A powerful computer that runs 24/7. It stores data, manages security, and provides services. Ideally, it has a high-bandwidth connection.

The Client (The Requester): A less powerful computer (laptop, smartphone) that requests content. It does not share its own resources with others.

The Process (Request-Response Cycle):

Request: The Client sends a message asking for a resource (e.g., "Send me the homepage of https://www.google.com/search?q=Google.com").

Process: The Server receives the request, checks if the client has permission, and locates the data.

Response: The Server sends the data back to the Client.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
The Democracy: "Everyone is Equal"

This model became famous with file-sharing apps (like Napster and BitTorrent) but is also used in blockchain. It is decentralized.

How It Works
There is no central boss. Every computer on the network is called a Peer.

Dual Role: Every peer acts as both a Client and a Server simultaneously.

Resource Sharing: Peer A can download a file from Peer B, while simultaneously uploading a different file to Peer C.

The Process:

Discovery: The network helps peers find other peers who have the data they need.

Direct Transfer: Data is transferred directly between user devices, bypassing any central storage.

firewall - A firewall is a security system designed to monitor and control the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network (like your home or office network) and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

ports-
In computer networking, ports are like doorways or entry points that allow different types of data to flow in and out of a device or network. Each port is associated with a specific service or application, so different types of data are directed to the correct program.

protocols-
Protocols are sets of rules or standards that define how data is transmitted and received between devices. They ensure that devices (such as computers, smartphones, and servers) can communicate with each other in a way that everyone understands, regardless of the manufacturer or type of device.

Just like folders on your computer, server directories help store and categorize files in a logical way.

-> Vulnerabilities Scanning
Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weaknesses and flaws in systems and networks by using automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities. It helps organizations detect potential entry points for attackers and prioritize remediation efforts to strengthen their security posture.
